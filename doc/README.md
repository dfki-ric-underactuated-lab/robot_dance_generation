# static landing page template

## basic usage:
- install pandoc (latest version from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.18)
- edit index.md to your liking (template based on the RSS submission). for youtube videos use the custom divs.
- run `./build.sh` to generate index.html
- manually deploy `index.html` and `static` folder (e.g. to gh pages) or run `python3 -m http.server` for previewing the site locally.

## notes on using gh pages
- put `index.html` and `static` inside a `doc` foler at the root of your repository.
- pages settings can be found under settings -> pages. make sure to select the right branch and folder.
